# CS50 - Cash

This program calculates the minimum number of coins needed to make change for a given amount of cents.
This was one of the first projects that I enjoyed working on during my first few cs50's weeks. 
Can be quite helpful when working with POS and helped me through my part time chair job.

## Usage
Compile the program with:
make cash

then run it with:
./cash

Then enter the amount of change owed, and the program will output the minimum number of coins.

## Example: 
Change owed: 0.41
4

## Notes
- Uses a greedy algorithm.
- Coins available: 25¢, 10¢, 5¢, and 1¢.
